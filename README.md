# Clipboard
For PowerApps Canvas App development. To copy the long formular here and reveiw/ edit/ string replacement operation. This is created to used in junction with Microsoft Visual Studio Code ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

# What I use in Power Apps (Power Fx)
* See the formula in a better code editor (You can get black background!!) [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes)
* Do custom formatting a bit easier (indentation) [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_indentation)
* Collapse view of the code based on function (Folding) [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_folding)
* Find and replace (Supports regex). [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_find-and-replace)
* Select all occurrences of current [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_basic-editing) (Check 17 from [this post](https://jsmanifest.com/21-vscode-shortcuts-to-code-faster-and-funner))
* Format json or html file [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting) (You may need some type of extension)
* Compare two set of code ([instruction](https://www.mytecbits.com/microsoft/dot-net/compare-contents-of-two-files-in-vs-code))
* It will temporarly save the code even you don't save the file it self. Basically having multiple clipboard that can store large amount of code (half volatile).
* Can make the code bigger if you want to see it bigger [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_zoom)

## Supported files
* js - Javascript
* html - HTML
* json - Javascript Object Notation
* txt - Text
* yaml - [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)

## Furthermore
As you can see the files provided in this git, there is nothing in each file. If you have a different file type that you want to add:
1. simply add a blank file into the folder
2. Name it with extension (e.g. md1.md)
3. Check the file extension and change if required ([Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_changing-the-language-for-the-selected-file))

## GUID Generator.xlsx
This is to generate some guid and random number in excel. I use this when I input some testing data into the app that I test.
